Possible Error: The Full Load Hours calculated on (S,T) from the variation profile given by WTRRSVAR_S is not close to the value given in WTRRSFLH for area AT_A                            :    6 against 1329: The generation profile in the simulation appears mostly to be further from the (higher) peak than expected from WTRRSVAR_S(AAA,SSS,TTT).
   The above check on Full Load Hours FLH was made with a tolerance on the quotient of 0.100
   CARD(S)*CARD(T) is 8736, if this number is much smaller than 8736 this may be the explanation, e.g. if the S and T selected do not contain VAR_T values that are representative for the whole year.

Possible Error: Not all elements in fuel set FFF are used in a GGG - OR - some element in fuel set FFF does not have a corresponding acronym.
                Acronyms should be entered in data file FFF.inc, after the final '/;', and must be made as an exact copy of the elements in the set FFF, preceded by the keyword ACRONYM and terminated by ';'.
